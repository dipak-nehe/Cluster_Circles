Supported Python Versions -Tested the script on Python 2.7.18  and Python 3.12.0 and scripts works fine on both which implies that all in-between versions are by default supported
I choose 2.7.18 as that is the widely available lower version of Python and 3.12.0 as it is the latest available version and it works fine on it.
